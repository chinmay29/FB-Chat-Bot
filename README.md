# FB-Chat-Bot
A chat bot for Facebook pages where the server is hosted on heroku and the bot responds to customer queries, shows different options to choose from, replies back. It works on the concept of API, implemented using Express with node js and also Facebook graph API

Create a page on facebook and get token from Facebook app to use it in the code

Paste the token inside code and deploy the Express server on heroku or some server hosting website

Keep the server up and running and sends the message through facebook chat for that page and get a response! :)
